Scout
=====
Scout is an experimental application which tests the effectiveness of using
bluetooth technology to gather customer data.


Install
-------

Scout has two applications, the Android mobile application and the web 
dashboard.

The mobile application is developed in Android Studio and we recommend you to
use this IDE to further development.  Simply open `ScoutMobile` with Android 
Studio and hit `run` to execute.

The web application uses node.js. To run the development server, simply 
navigate to the `ScoutWeb` folder in the command line and run `node app.js` 
start the local server on localhost port 3000 .
